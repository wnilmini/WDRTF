This file is the supplementary audio files for the paper "Microphone Aligned Continuous Wearable Device-related Transfer Function:  Efficient Modeling and Measurements" submitted to Hands-free Speech Communication and Microphone Arrays (HSCMA) workshop 2024.

The folders contain audio files both input and outputs of the speech enhancement application using (i) the MVDR [1] and (ii) the subspace hybrid (SS-Hybrid) [2] beamforming methods. 


Example 01: contains the non-overlapping speakers

Example 02: contains concurrent speakers
